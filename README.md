# contacts-pasrer

Give a file name as an argument to the program, and that file will be parsed to a 'Contact' list.

It is possible to save the profile picture of a contact by calling to 'show_image()' or 'save_image()'.

The difference is that 'show_image()' will first save the image (if not already saved), and 'save_image()' will just save it without presenting the image.

I've assumed that the identifiers for each row are unique and will be the same in every file, though it is possible to give an alternative dictionary with different row identifiers.

For any questions - feel free to ask.
